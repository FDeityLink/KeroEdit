KeroEdit - the Kero Blaster editor!
by FDeityLink
v0.0.1
Last updated 2017-02-16

This is a Kero Blaster editor that allows you to edit Pink Hour, Pink Heaven, and of course Kero Blaster games so you
can make your own games based on those engines. To start, you just have to load a game executable, open a map, and start
editing!

Documentation will be coming for file formats, how to write scripts, what cool things you can do with maps in comparison
to Cave Story, and finally KeroEdit itself.
